# ZK Eigen Trust
A library for managing trust in a distributed network with zero-knowledge features.

## Main characteristics:
**Self-policing** - the shared ethics of the user population is defined and enforced by the peers themselves and not by some central authority.

**Minimal** - computation, infrastructure, storage, and message complexity are reduced to a minimum.

**Incorruptible** - Reputation should be obtained by consistent good behavior through several transactions. This is enforced for all users, so no one can cheat the system and obtain a higher reputation. It is also resistant to malicious collectives.
